**WIP - Currently testing and not ready for use**

# Setup from default for Rust

Run [setup script](setup.sh)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://c-git.github.io/github/codespaces/setup.sh | sh
```

# Use devcontainer

I found [this post](https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile) helpful to get an idea of the options available.

I also found a repo microsoft with pre-configured dev containers <https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/rust>

# Pricing

By default you cannot perform actions that would result in billing according the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#billing-for-codespaces).

Go to [settings](https://github.com/settings/billing/summary) to see your usage.
