# Foreword

I used to keep them in a playlist on youtube but that's harder to maintain and I can't add explanations of why I keep the video around.

# General Interest

- [Magic Number](https://youtube.com/shorts/MjcLeWcoVgo?si=W_qU0wDr5x_6T_O8) - spoiler... It's 1089
  - Take any 3 digit number and subtract the reverse
  - Ignore any negative sign (use absolute value of answer)
  - Add the reverse of the number and you get...

# Rust

- [Rust Data Modelling WITHOUT CLASSES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-0-bbc80JM)
  - I really appreciated the state machine example along with the fact that it so succinctly explains why I prefer rust enums over inheritance

# To be updated

I'll add the rest some other time (if you're interested before I add them create an issue on github, see link below').
