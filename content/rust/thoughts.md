I kept having thoughts / observations that I wanted to write somewhere so putting them here.

# Rust isn't actually hard

Rust isn't actually hard, giving up bad habits is hard.
I actually think if your first programming language is rust then it's easier to pick up and become productive.
Happy to get some counter examples, if you have some please do create an issue on github and let me know. (Link below).

# Tooling really matters

When I started with rust I was pleased with the tooling and that hasn't changed but I acknowledge that it matters to how much I enjoy using the language.
The right IDE and other supporting tools drastically changes the experience one has with a language.
Don't underestimate the value of a good editor, compiler, linter or formatter.
I personally do not like formatting code by hand seems like a waste of time and code completion is table stakes.
If it is context aware that's all the better (but feels like table stakes, don't think I can go back to manually narrowing down results).
