# Emails

I noticed that github cc's specific email addresses depending on the reason for the notification. Found a list of them on [their site](https://docs.github.com/en/subscriptions-and-notifications/reference/email-notification-headers).
Copied below in case the site gets moved or something.

> GitHub will `cc` you if you're subscribed to a conversation. The second `cc` email address matches the notification reason. The suffix for these notification reasons is `@noreply.github.com`. The possible notification reasons are:
>
> `assign`: You were assigned to an issue or pull request.\
> `author`: You created an issue or pull request.\
> `ci_activity`: A GitHub Actions workflow run that you triggered was completed.\
> `comment`: You commented on an issue or pull request.\
> `manual`: There was an update to an issue or pull request you manually subscribed to.\
> `mention`: You were mentioned on an issue or pull request.\
> `push`: Someone committed to a pull request you're subscribed to.\
> `review_requested`: You or a team you're a member of was requested to review a pull request.\
> `security_alert`: GitHub detected a vulnerability in a repository you receive alerts for.\
> `state_change`: An issue or pull request you're subscribed to was either closed or opened.\
> `subscribed`: There was an update in a repository you're watching.\
> `team_mention`: A team you belong to was mentioned on an issue or pull request.\
> `your_activity`: You opened, commented on, or closed an issue or pull request.
