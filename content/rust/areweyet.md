There are several "Are we x yet?" websites for rust. Mozilla has a [compilation of "areweyet"](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Areweyet) sites but it's not only rust. This github repo called [AreWeRustYet](https://github.com/UgurcanAkkok/AreWeRustYet) appears to be rust focused and has summaries not sure of how updated it is, but still found it faster to find the one I was looking for there.

I'm personally interested in the following:

- [Aerospace](https://aerorust.org/catalogue/)
- [GUI](https://areweguiyet.com/)
- [Machine Learning](https://www.arewelearningyet.com/)
