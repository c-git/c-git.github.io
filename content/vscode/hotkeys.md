Compilation of hotkeys I use and those I rarely use but really want and then have a hard time finding.
Might hide the frequency column in the future but kept to make them easy to sort.

Reference link: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings>

| Freq | Key Combination | Description     |
| :--- | :-------------- | :-------------- |
| High | Ctrl+Shift+P    | Command Palette |
| Med  | Ctrl+Shift+T    | Reopen Tab      |
