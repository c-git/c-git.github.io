# Foreword

Some shortcuts are more like things you might not be able to do another way and those are documented here.
These are generally ones you only need if you have problems or like what they do.
But I started this because it was to be able to _UNDO_ things I didn't want to happen.

# Switch Between User Interfaces

Source: <https://askubuntu.com/questions/123493/screen-went-black>

`Ctrl + Alt + Fx` where `Fx` is `F1` through `F6` on Ubuntu 22.04.1

What they did:

- `F1` - Took me to a logon prompt but did not log me out on the other "Interface"
- `F2` - Took me back to my "Normal" UI
- `F3` - tty3
- `F4` - tty4
- `F5` - tty5
- `F6` - tty6

Found out about these when I accidentally ended up on a text screen and didn't know how to get out.
