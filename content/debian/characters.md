# Frequently used codes

Press "ctrl + shift + u" then a 'u' should show up.
Then enter the unicode code point in hexadecimal for the character you want.
It is not case sensitive and leading 0's are not required.

- è - e8
- ¢ - a2
- € - 20ac

# Typing characters not on the keyboard

Notes from testing:

- If you find the key in the character map program it will give you the unicode value (which is what the code some of the other methods are asking for)
- The emoji option "ctrl+;" put me in an "e" kind of mode but couldn't figure out how to make it work. No menu showed up as they said it would.
- "ctrl + shift + u" is the only one that worked for me.
