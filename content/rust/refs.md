# Podcasts

- [Rustacean Station](https://rustacean-station.org/) - Current community run podcast
- [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com/) - Stopped but it's where I started. This podcast introduced me to rust and got me excited before I read the book and actually tried it myself (converted commute time into see if I like this rust thing time). I think the main reason it got me excited is that he spoke about the parts of rust that I was interested in and maybe contributed to making it easier to learn rust. I found learning rust easy but that's not a sentiment I've heard from many other people so maybe this is why it was easy for me.

# Useful crates

For some crates I have more detailed notes.
For those their page title starts with "Crate ".
And for ease of maintenance they are not duplicated here.
So please do see the [section page](../index.html) for rust to see the list.

- [log](https://docs.rs/log/) - A lightweight logging facade
- [log4rs](https://docs.rs/log4rs/) - a highly configurable logging framework modeled after Javaâ€™s Logback and log4j libraries.
  - Logging patterns [patterns](https://docs.rs/log4rs/*/log4rs/encode/pattern/index.html)
- [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html)
  - [Shorthand Macros](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#shorthand-macros)
- [float_eq](https://docs.rs/float_eq/) - Compare IEEE floating point primitives, structs and collections for equality
- [float_ord](https://docs.rs/float-ord/latest/float_ord/) - Add Ord for floats (used as `FloatOrd(1.0)`)
- [inventory](https://docs.rs/inventory/) - Typed distributed plugin registration.
- [dirs](https://crates.io/crates/dirs) - Helps you find the suitable directory to use in a cross platform way
- -[secrecy](https://crates.io/crates/secrecy) - Simple secret keeping library. Small API surface and reasonable protection from mistakes.
- [version](https://docs.rs/version/latest/version/) - Easy way to check the version of a executable compiled with cargo (clap is probably better if it's just to add a CLI arg to show to users)
