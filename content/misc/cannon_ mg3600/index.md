## Steps to Connect to New Wi-Fi

NB: Must be reset to connect to new network.
Read **ALL** the instructions before you start as the timing is a bit tricky.

- Ensure WPS is enabled and prepare to press the button on short notice (can be from the web interface if supported but pull it up on your phone to get to it quickly).
- Press and hold the [Resume / Cancel] Button until the alarm button flashes 21 times\

- At this point the power light should be flashing.
  Press and hold the **WI-FI Button** on the printer until the power light stops flashing and then flashes once.
- Press the WPS button now (Not sure how long have to do this step but I try to do it quickly to get to the next step before it goes out of the state it's in waiting for the black button to be pressed)
- Press the **Black Button**
- Press the **Wi-Fi Button** again the Wi-Fi light will start to flash\
