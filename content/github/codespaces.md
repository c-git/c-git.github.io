# Setup from default for Rust

Will try to turn this into a template when I have time but for now documenting the changes I need to make every time.

<!-- TODO: Add link to older docs -->

1. [Install rust](@/rust/install.md#installation)
2. vscode plugin names (for more that might be useful see [full list](https://c-git.github.io/broken_link_until_I_move_in_the_older_docs))
   1. `vadimcn.vscode-lldb`
   2. `rust-lang.rust-analyzer`
   3. `usernamehw.errorlens`

# Pricing

By default you cannot perform actions that would result in billing according the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#billing-for-codespaces).

Go to [settings](https://github.com/settings/billing/summary) to see your usage.
