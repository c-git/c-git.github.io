Me\nI’m better known online as Onè.\nI’m a software developer by trade and passion.\nI’ve been programming since high school and have always loved the thrill of the journey to the solution.\nProgramming, just like life, is about perspective.\nA change in perspective can bring into focus opportunities instead of just problems.\nI attained a Master’s degree in Computer Science from York University, under the supervision of Dr. Ruth Urner.\nIn my thesis, titled “AN AXIOMATIC PERSPECTIVE ON ANOMALY DETECTION”, we created a foundation for the development of a line of theoretical work on anomaly detection (outlier detection).\nThis work showed vulnerabilities in methods that are still in ongoing use.\nWe also have a paper, titled “An Axiomatic Perspective on Anomaly Detection” published in the 27TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ECAI 2024).\nAs part of my thesis I also developed two tools that facilitated my research.\nOne was a framework in python to manage running experiments and the other was a tool written in Rust using egui to build and edit datasets.\nThe dataset builder is able to be run in the browser using WASM.\nOpen source projects\nFeatured Projects\nRepositories\nCrates Published\nMy python helper library (Cut down repeated code between projects)\nAbout this site\nThis site primarily serves as my notes on various subjects.\nI decided to share them publicly so that it may benefit others as well.\nFeel free to reach out via github issues with any feedback.\nHappy for any questions, comments, emotional

+ Z instead of Ctrl + C one day and not knowing what to do.\nThis isn’t always a big deal unless the program that was running locked some resource you want to use.\nClosing the terminal “fixes” it but that might be inconvenient.\nWhat Ctrl + Z does is suspend the program instead of stopping it like Ctrl + C.\nSo it’s not running but it’s basically paused and in the background.\nThere are two

Not sure.)\nA file in the file system is basically a link to an inode.\nA hard link, then, just creates another file with a link to the same underlying inode.\nWhen you delete a file, it removes one link to the underlying inode. The inode is only deleted (or deletable/over-writable) when all links to the inode have been deleted.\nA symbolic link is a link to another name in the file system.\nOnce a hard link has been made the link is to the inode. Deleting, renaming, or moving the original file will not affect the hard link as it links to the underlying inode. Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.\nNote: Hard links are only valid within the same File System.

Path Sum III\nCoding up brute force is a good starting point but a better starting point is just typing out or writing up what you need to keep track of to solve it as a human.\nAdd “digital” constraints like only looking at one variable at a time and then try to solve and see where you have repeated work and things like that which could cause the optimal solution to fall out.\nIn the example problem once I looked at Deepti manually solve it, the solution became obvious and I wasn’t stuck anymore.\n424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement\nAlso note where information you track gets used.\nIs this example, Neetcode was able to drop the constant 26 in the O(26n) down to 1 by tracking the max frequency.\nThis works (also explained in the video) because the only time we can increase the result is when we find a new max.\nBefore that it really doesn’t matter, so having a max that is too high does not have negative side effects.\nTips for detecting DP\n139. Word Break\nI eventually solved the problem by patterning on Deepti’s solution.\nWhat I think I missed is that even though because of how the question is constructed the ways must be tried, brute force even with a trie would be too slow as it’s exponential.\nLesson: If the ways really must be tried and trying them is exponential, it’s likely a dynamic programming (DP) problem.\nRearrange formulas (especially if modulus is involved - think of operations closed under modulus (+,-,*))\nSource: Taken from Hint #2 for problem.\n2364. Count Number of Bad Pairs\n2845. Count of Interesting Subarrays\nCheck to see if formulas in question can be rearranged into one that is easier to optimize for\nNotice that (j - i != nums[j] - nums[i]) is the same as (nums[i] - i != nums[j] - j).\nConsider partition_point\nInspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjthKf7Mc_8\n33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array\n34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array\n704. Binary Search\nWhen you need binary search consider using partition_point function from rust std. If it’s not allowed manually implement as below.\nBe comfortable with permutations\n46. Permutations\nSometimes brute force is what the question wants.\nI prefer Heap’s Algorithm but it’s too difficult to memorize.\nSo instead I think the iterative solution from the video is the easiest to remember without feeling too icky\nBe comfortable with subsets\n78. Subsets\nNote that this is not subarrays.\nSimilarly to permutations an iterative approach can be used to just add all numbers to the end only instead of all positions like permutations.\nInterview Preparation\nIn my opinion if you already have experience with leetcode then a good video to start with is this one from Uncle Steve where he starts of with summarizing the article How well do LeetCode ratings predict interview performance?

down.\nThat could be I’ve told it to people often so maybe writing it down will help someone.\nAnd maybe that someone is me after a period of time when I forget it (or at least don’t have it in mind and am reminded, possibly after wasting a lot of time in the process).\nFunction length\nKeep your functions short.\nThere are times violating this rule is the right thing to do but if the function is so long that all of the function can’t fit on your screen you better not be tired so you can remember the context of the part you can’t see.\nIt also makes coming back to the code later harder as you need to try work with a bigger context window.\nIt also tends to encourage functions that have more than one responsibility.\nDeleting files on linux\nDeleting a folder does not kick out (close) any terminals in that folder.\nTechnically I didn’t learn that today but I experienced it for the first time today.\nI think presenting this one as a narrative may prove more entertaining and less like random and somewhat useless knowledge.\nClick to expand!\nIt all started with me trying to create a new egui project.\nI decided to use my template (Note sunset my version of the template wasn’t worth the maintenance costs) which I wrote a setup script for.\nThe sequence of events went like this:\nIn vscode use Open folder... to create a folder (using the open dialog) and open that folder.\nOpen the built in terminal\nRealize I would prefer use a separate terminal (Open one from vscode, because it opens in the correct folder)\nNavigate up one folder and use the trash program to remove the current folder.\nUse the template setup tool to create a new folder.\nIn the built in terminal I saw no files when I did ll\nDid a cd .. then went back in and ll now showed the files.\nI’d done a few pwd in between to make sure I was in the folder I expected because zsh doesn’t show the folder in the prompt.\nAt first I couldn’t understand what had happened then realized I was still in the folder but that folder was in the trash and thus was still a “valid” folder but not the same as the one I wanted to use even though pwd had the same output.\nSteps to reproduce\nTo keep it simple, I’ll just demonstrate using two terminal windows\nKnown assumptions\nBoth terminals in the same working director\nll = ls with some args as is default on Ubuntu.\ntrash program is installed (sudo apt install trash-cli)\nFrom Terminal 1\nFrom Terminal 2\nFrom Terminal 1 (now in the original folder that is in the trash still sees the same output for pwd and ll)\nFrom Terminal 2 in the “new” folder shows the new contents (bob)\nIf you use rm -r folder instead of trash you can no longer add any files in terminal 1 after that command and the output of ll only shows Total 0.\nShare by default\nOften making something shared makes it easier for you to access from more places.\nNot everything should be made public and once you do you can’t always take it back but double check before you assume it needs to be private.\nEven if no one else uses it, you might be making it easier for yourself at least.\n(Kinda what this site is about…)\nCtrl + D to send EOF\nI was reading up websocat while learning how to use websockets and they said I should use Ctrl + D to close.\nSo I decided to look it up as that wasn’t a key combination I was familiar with in the terminal.\nFound info on it on superuser and basically it sends EOF which closes stdin, which can signal to the program that you want to close.\nWhen used on the terminal it is a faster way to close the terminal window than typing exit.\nDiátaxis\nA systematic approach to technical documentation authoring.\nMentioned to me by robjtede @ Actix Web\nClick to expand!\nSource: https://diataxis.fr/\nDiátaxis is a way of thinking about and doing documentation.\nIt prescribes approaches to content, architecture and form that emerge from a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users.\nDiátaxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs.\nImage Source: https://diataxis.fr/_images/diataxis.png\nImportance of Documentation\nIt actually comes back to why are you working on the project being documented.\nIs it just to experiment?\nIs it to create a usable artifact that you expect to only be useful for a short period of time?\nAt the end of the day we have limited time and need to be conscious of how we choose to use that limited resource.\nThe next person (might be you) may be able to figure it out again by looking at the code but you could drastically cut down the time needed if you add documentation.\nSo really it’s more about do you expect someone to need to look at the code in the future (again this future might be you), is there any small thing you can do to help them out?\nSometimes you can re-derive a process but documenting processes I’ve found to be the most important because it’s not always trivial to come up with them again and may end up requiring making the same mistakes again what you’ve already made.\nGithub CI stdin can trick programs\nIf you are using a program in GitHub CI be careful if the program takes a path or stdin because some “smart” programs detect CI as supplying stdin when really it’s not.\nIn my case it was ripgrep.\nI needed to specify a path to get it to work eg rg MY_REGEX . where the dot specifies the current folder.\nThere is a very good explanation on the ripgrep repo.","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/misc/til/","title":"Today I Learned (TIL)"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/misc/veracrypt/":{"body":"Sizes of Created Encrypted file containers\nForeword: Created a file container and then tried to copy the files in and got informed the files couldn’t fit even though I’d left quite a bit of headroom.\nThen noticed a lot of space from what I selected was missing.\nThis is the second time this happened to me and decided to write it down for next time.\nProcedure\nObjective create multiple containers all set to the same size to compare the container sizes produced\nCreate an encrypted file container\nStandard VeraCrypt volume\nVolume Size\n10 MiB\n100 MiB\n1000 MiB\nSelect Format\n2.

Sign of the cross\nBegin by making the sign of the cross.\nIn the name of Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.\nStep 2. Prayer for the day\nThen, listen or read the words that Jesus spoke to Fr. Dolindo Ruotolo and that He continues to speak to us.\nEach day of the novena, listen and reflect on His words and consider how He is leading you to peace and comfort throughout the next nine days and forever.\nFor me I found that reading the prayer for the day a few times, instead of once, helped me understand it a bit more and helped me apply it to my situation.\nLink to jump to days:\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\nDay 4\nDay 5\nDay 6\nDay 7\nDay 8\nDay 9\nDay 1\nWhy do you confuse yourselves by worrying? Leave the care of your affairs to me and everything will be peaceful.\nI say to you in truth that every act of true, blind, complete surrender to me produces the effect that you desire and resolves all difficult situations.\nGo to step 3\nDay 2\nSurrender to me does not mean to fret, to be upset, or to lose hope, nor does it mean offering to me a worried prayer asking me to follow you and change your worry into prayer.\nIt is against this surrender, deeply against it, to worry, to be nervous and to desire to think about the consequences of anything.\nIt is like the confusion that children feel when they ask their mother to see to their needs, and then try to take care of those needs for themselves so that their childlike efforts get in their mother’s way.\nSurrender means to placidly close the eyes of the soul, to turn away from thoughts of tribulation and to put yourself in my care, so that only I act, saying, “You take care of it.”\nGo to step 3\nDay 3\nHow many things I do when the soul, in so much spiritual and material need, turns to me, looks at me and says to me, “You take care of it,” then closes its eyes and rests.\nIn pain you pray for me to act, but that I act in the way you want.\nYou do not turn to me, instead, you want me to adapt to your ideas.\nYou are not sick people who ask the doctor to cure you, but rather sick people who tell the doctor how to.\nSo do not act this way, but pray as I taught you in the Our Father: “Hallowed be thy Name,” that is, be glorified in my need.\n“Thy kingdom come,” that is, let all that is in us and in the world be in accord with your kingdom.\n“Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,” that is, in our need, decide as you see fit for our temporal and eternal life.\nIf you say to me truly: “Thy will be done,” which is the same as saying: “You take care of it,” I will intervene with all my omnipotence, and I will resolve the most difficult situations.\nGo to step 3\nDay 4\nYou see evil growing instead of weakening? Do not worry.\nClose your eyes and say to me with faith: “Thy will be done, You take care of it.”\nI say to you that I will take care of it, and that I will intervene as does a doctor and I will accomplish miracles when they are needed.\nDo you see that the sick person is getting worse? Do not be upset, but close your eyes and say, “You take care of it.”\nI say to you that I will take care of it, and that there is no medicine more powerful than my loving intervention.\nBy my love, I promise this to you.\nGo to step 3\nDay 5\nAnd when I must lead you on a path different from the one you see, I will prepare you; I will carry you in my arms; I will let you find yourself, like children who have fallen asleep in their mother’s arms, on the other bank of the river.\nWhat troubles you and hurts you immensely are your reason, your thoughts and worry, and your desire at all costs to deal with what afflicts you.\nGo to step 3\nDay 6\nYou are sleepless; you want to judge everything, direct everything and see to everything and you surrender to human strength, or worse—to men themselves, trusting in their intervention—this is what hinders my words and my views.\nOh, how much I wish from you this surrender, to help you; and how I suffer when I see you so agitated! Satan tries to do exactly this: to agitate you and to remove you from my protection and to throw you into the jaws of human initiative.\nSo, trust only in me, rest in me, surrender to me in everything.\nGo to step 3\nDay 7\nI perform miracles in proportion to your full surrender to me and to your not thinking of yourselves.\nI sow treasure troves of graces when you are in the deepest poverty.\nNo person of reason, no thinker, has ever performed miracles, not even among the saints.\nHe does divine works whosoever surrenders to God.\nSo don’t think about it any more, because your mind is acute and for you it is very hard to see evil and to trust in me and to not think of yourself.\nDo this for all your needs, do this, all of you, and you will see great continual silent miracles.\nI will take care of things, I promise this to you.\nGo to step 3\nDay 8\nClose your eyes and let yourself be carried away on the flowing current of my grace; close your eyes and do not think of the present, turning your thoughts away from the future just as you would from temptation.\nRepose in me, believing in my goodness, and I promise you by my love that if you say, “You take care of it,” I will take care of it all; I will console you, liberate you and guide you.\nGo to step 3\nDay 9\nPray always in readiness to surrender, and you will receive from it great peace and great rewards, even when I confer on you the grace of immolation, of repentance, and of love.\nThen what does suffering matter? It seems impossible to you? Close your eyes and say with all your soul, “Jesus, you take care of it.”\nDo not be afraid, I will take care of things and you will bless my name by humbling yourself.\nA thousand prayers cannot equal one single act of surrender, remember this well.\nThere is no novena more effective than this.\nGo to step 3\nStep 3. Repeat the surrender refrain 10 times.\n“O Jesus, I surrender myself to You, take care of everything!”\nStep 4. Closing prayer\n“Mother, I am yours now and forever. Through you and with you, I always want to belong completely to Jesus.”\nStep 5. Sign of the cross\nConclude with the sign of the cross.\nIn the name of Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/prayers/surrender-novena/","title":"Surrender Novena"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/privacy/":{"body":"Privacy\nThis site does not set or use cookies.\nThis site does not store data in the browser to be shared, sent, or sold to third-parties.\nNo personal information is shared, sent, or sold to third-parties.\nEffective Date: 1st Jan 2022","description":"This page outlines the Privacy Policy for this site, and the date at which this policy was put into affect.","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/privacy/","title":"Privacy Policy"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/","title":"PyCharm"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/disable-formatter-on-part-of-code/":{"body":"Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14020200/how-to-config-intellij-idea-not-format-some-part-of-the-code\nHow to use\nRequired Settings\nEnsure it is enabled in settings\nSearch String: “formatter markers”\nEditor -&gt; Code Style: Formatter : Turn formatter on/off with markers in code comments","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/disable-formatter-on-part-of-code/","title":"Disable Formatter on parts of Code"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/javascript/":{"body":"See linting under javascript.","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/javascript/","title":"JavaScript"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/launcher/":{"body":"Source: https://askubuntu.com/questions/391439/how-can-i-set-up-pycharm-to-launch-from-the-launcher\nOpen pycharm (See instructions that come in folder)\nOnce you’ve opened PyCharm then go to Tools -&gt; Create Desktop Entry...","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/launcher/","title":"Launcher Shortcut"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/live-templates/":{"body":"Create new\nSource: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-editing-live-templates.html\nTLDR\nGo to Settings -&gt; Editor -&gt; Live Templates\nCopy a similar one and paste it (ensure to define contexts in which it can be used)\nDetails\nFor details see instructions from source.","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/live-templates/","title":"Live Templates"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/regex/":{"body":"Also see my page on regex where I have a cookbook of regexes I wrote or found and think I may use again.","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/pycharm/regex/","title":"RegExp Editor"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/","title":"Python"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/freq-lookup/":{"body":"Compare two floats as approximately equal\nSource: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/freq-lookup/","title":"Frequently looked up functions"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/get-func-name/":{"body":"Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5067604/determine-function-name-from-within-that-function-without-using-traceback","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/get-func-name/","title":"Get the current function's name"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/ipython-built-in-magic-commands/":{"body":"Source: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html\nDefined Variables (with types)\nDefined Variables","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/ipython-built-in-magic-commands/","title":"IPython Built-in magic commands"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/python/memory/":{"body":"Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html\nSee excerpt from introductory paragraph\nTo trace most memory blocks allocated by Python, the module should be started as early as possible by setting the PYTHONTRACEMALLOC environment variable to 1, or by using -X tracemalloc command line option.

Our manifest declared uuid = “1.0” which means we’ll only resolve to &gt;= 1.0.0, &lt; 2.0.0, and Cargo’s greedy resolution algorithm also means that we’ll resolve to the maximum version within that range. Typically this doesn’t matter as the version of the git repository will already be greater or match the maximum version published on crates.io, but it’s important to keep this in mind!\nBolding applied is my own.\nIf you need to patch often it is worthwhile looking into cargo-override which automates overriding crates.","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/rust/cargo/","title":"Cargo"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/rust/ci/":{"body":"Source: https://youtu.be/xUH-4y92jPg?si=3eY_i02onu60bVQ4&amp;t=495\nSource GitRepo: https://github.com/jonhoo/rust-ci-conf/\nOur GitRepo: https://github.com/wykies/rust-ci-conf/\nLink to CI Repo\nTo add to a repo with option to pull changes later\nFor SSH\nFor HTTPS (Not tested)\nFetch from CI Repo\nInitially merge into current history\nWarning: If you are using gitflow, initialize it BEFORE doing this.

This may not be the only possible reason, more testing was not done to disprove other solutions.\nDiscovered this by:\nRunning the initial merge command on main\nRepeating the initial merge on main to confirm it says “Already up to date”\nInitializing gitflow\nTrying the initial merge command again on develop and noticing that it brought in all the history again.\nRepeated several times and each time it brought in all the history again\nAfter resting the history I did it on develop and repeated without issue.\nBranched off develop and used the initial merge command again and it said up to date\nI also ended up in the problem situation after gitflow had been started, when I used the sync button in vscode.\nDidn’t do more testing to figure it out but noted so avoid ending up in that problem again or for later testing.","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/rust/ci/","title":"CI"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/rust/conditional-compilation/":{"body":"Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39204908/how-to-check-release-debug-builds-using-cfg-in-rust\nSource: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#debug_assertions\nSource: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#the-cfg_attr-attribute\nAllows to have different code compile under different circumstances.\nExample","description":"","id":"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/rust/conditional-compilation/","title":"Conditional Compilation"},"https://dev.chester.wykies.com/rust/crate-actix/":{"body":"Website: https://actix.rs/\nList of useful doc items\nErrors\nError Helpers\nFunctions\nLogging Middleware\nLog (record) unmatched routes\nAdd a default service and route (This example uses tracing to do the recording)\nGraceful shutdown\nThere are multiple references I found and the appropriate one depends on your use case.\nI’m collecting them here because I don’t want to have to search for them again.\nI recommend also checking out Tokio Cancellation Tokens as well as applicable to your use case.\nResources:\nOfficial example of shutdown - It shows how to shutdown from an endpoint\nExample Response to issue - Shows how to shutdown if there is another task running in parallel to actix_web.

(A bit more explanation in the Podcast section).\nCourses - The best course I’ve done on rust is 100 Exercises To Learn Rust by Mainmatter.\nThe principle author is Luca Palmieri who wrote Zero To Production In Rust, referenced in the bullet point on books.\nBooks - It would be remiss of me not to lead with The Rust Book that many people start with.\nIt’s pretty good and easy to follow.\nThis is what I started with after the New Rustacean podcast.\nThere is also an experimental interactive version hosted by the Cognitive Engineering Lab at Brown University.\nThere is also a repository of rust book on github you can have a look at for other book options https://github.com/sger/RustBooks.\nIf you intend to write a RESTful back end in Rust I can strongly recommend Zero To Production In Rust which I used personally and found tremendous value in.\nI really appreciated practical approach that was used to deliver the content that Luca used.\nHe not only covers the recommended approach but covers other approaches one may “intuitively” come up with and explains the trade offs.\nThis along with the full source code from the project, which makes great starter code for a project, and a discord for book owners where you can ask questions makes this a invaluable resource in my opinion.\nI think you will get more out of the book if you develop the example project along with the book but you can also just read it if you don’t feel like getting hands on and referring back to it after.\nNew to programming\nI’ve started of teaching a few people to program from scratch using rust but due to changes in life circumstances I’ve never actually finished covering all the material I wanted to so I can’t vouch for this process working yet.\nI actually think rust isn’t that much harder to learn to program in, and it saves you from learning bad habits that you need to then later go back and fix.\nI personally suspect that people find rust hard because it’s different and I think going from rust to many other imperative languages is easier than the reverse.\nThus far I’ve found starting off people with the book Begin Rust which is designed for high school students seem to work well.\nThe first 3 chapters are available for free on their website which allows me to start with new students and see if\nthey like the content and\nif this is the right book to use with them.\nIt provides structure and exercise to work though.\nI’ve tried it with a few students ranging in age from 7 to 40 years.\nFor the younger students I’ve had to cover a bit of the math but it didn’t seem like too much for them.\nThey got it and were able to do some of the practice problems.\nOfficial\nRust Cookbook\nAPI Guidelines Checklist\nNaming conventions - API Guide\nDocumentation - API Guide\nImplement From not Into - Trait std::convert::Into\nSelecting a collection - Module std::collections\nSetting up defaults - Trait std::default::Default\nAttributes - The Rust Reference\nCode like #![] and #[]\nMinimal Reproducible Example tips - Stack Overflow Rust Info\nConditional Compilation\nThe Rust Reference\nInternal Notes\nManaging External Processes - Rust Cookbook\nTesting CLI Applications by running them\nCLI Book\nExample Snippet\nFiling reports of unclear error messages (Choose Diagnostic) - Rust Issues\nCrate.io and Docs.rs issue status - https://status.crates.io/\nBuild Queue for Docs.rs - docs.rs\nRaw Pointers - std docs\nMagic Completions - Rust Analyzer User Manual\nDirectory Traversal - Rust Cookbook\nRecommended way to write expect messages - std docs\nTypes of enum variants - Rust by Example\nUsing a your fork of a crate while developing a feature - The Cargo Book - Testing a bugfix\nReference Books (Also see Official)\nCollection patters, idioms and anti-patterns - Rust design patterns\nBlog Posts\nDefault arguments for functions in Rust using macros\nExplanation of Tracing Subscribers\nPodcasts\nRustacean Station - Current community run podcast\nRust in Production - Interviews with companies using rust in production.\nRustShip - Interviews with companies that ship rust software.\nSelf-Directed Research Podcast (SDR) - “Every week, a new presentation on what Amos or James has been up to.

This podcast introduced me to rust and got me excited before I read the book and actually tried it myself (was able to use commute time to see if I like this “rust thing” I kept hearing people talking about). I think the main reason it got me excited is that the author, Chris Krycho, spoke about the parts of rust that I was interested in and maybe contributed to making it easier to learn rust.
