## About Me

I'm better known online as Onè.
I'm a software developer by trade and passion.
I've been programming since high school and have always loved the thrill of the journey to the solution.
Programming, just like life, is about perspective.
A change in perspective can bring into focus opportunities instead of just problems.

I attained a Master’s degree in Computer Science from [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/), under the supervision of [Dr. Ruth Urner](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~uruth/).
In my thesis, titled "AN AXIOMATIC PERSPECTIVE ON ANOMALY DETECTION", we created a foundation for the development of a line of theoretical work on anomaly detection (outlier detection).
This work showed vulnerabilities in methods that are still in ongoing use.
I also have a paper ([ID# M2671](https://www.ecai2024.eu/programme/accepted-papers)), with the same title as my thesis, that has been accepted at the 27TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ([ECAI 2024](https://www.ecai2024.eu/)).

As part of my thesis I also developed two tools that facilitated my research.
One was a [framework in python](https://github.com/uruth-lab/experiment_framework) to manage running experiments and the other was a tool written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) to [build and edit datasets](https://github.com/uruth-lab/dbv/).
The dataset builder is able to be [run in the browser](https://uruth-lab.github.io/dbv/) using [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).
