**Foreword**: I didn't always learn the thing at that time but that's when something caused me to say you know what I should write this down.
That could be I've told it to people often so maybe writing it down will help someone.
And maybe that someone is me after a period of time when I forget it (or at least don't have it in mind and am reminded, possibly after wasting a lot of time in the process).

# Function length

Keep your functions short.

- There are times violating this rule is the right thing to do but if the function is so long that all of the function can't fit on your screen you better not be tired so you can remember the context of the part you can't see.
- It also makes coming back to the code later harder as you need to try work with a bigger context window.
- It also tends to encourage functions that have more than one responsibility.
